2. What did Richard Stallman describe as an ethical dilemma?
Richard Stallman thaught that whoever sitting infront of a computer should be able to do whatever he wants with it.
In that time, to get the newest computers, you had to use a proprietory operating system that you couldn't share 
with anybody and you had to sign a contract to say that you won't share it with other people, witch is like 
signing up to be a bad person. To solve this ethical dillema, he started to work on a operating system that 
he would share and encourage people to share it.


3. What are the freedoms that enable people to form a community?
The freedoms that enable people to form a community is that they are not free to create software and share it, if 
all the software is controlled by someone, it divides poeple and doesn't allow them to share what they create new content.
All the softwares that are not free, don't give freedom to their users and to the people in general.
