These tables and charts show us the countries who emit the most CO2 in the world and these stats expose the climate change problem 
and show us how much we truly pollute and how much we contribute to the climate change.

These charts and tables show us the most important statistics concerning CO2 emissions and all the countries who eject this gas
in massive quantities. We can see that most of these countries are situated in Asia, so this continent pollutes the most. In fact, 
these charts show us the top 20 countries who had the most CO2 emissions in 2016(in metric tons), this shows us what countries are 
truly responsible for climate change. We can also see the 2016 per capita emissions from fuel combustion (metric tons) for these same 
20 countries. We can also see the average of every component of the tables and charts for every country and continent. This helps 
us to expose the countries and the continents who eject most of the worlds CO2. Another thing we can see is the average of total 
emissions of CO2 in 2016(million metric tons) in percentage for every continent and country in the top 20. One more thing in these 
tables are the Average per capita emissions from fuel combustion (metric tons) in 2016 and the average for this component for the 
counties and the continents. This component shows us how much CO2 every citizen of a country ejects in every county/continent(average). 
It can show to some people how much they truly pollute.
