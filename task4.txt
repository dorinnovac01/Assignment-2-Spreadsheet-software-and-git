The editor Atom is something that I discovered recently. I think that the editor Atom is very useful and easy to use for
a lot of reasons. First of all, editor Atom is very clear and the instructions on how to use it are very clear and easy
to understand. Secondly, it has git control and it was developed by GitHub. Also, it's free to use, which is great. 
Editor Atom is also very convenient to use, because it was developed by GitHub. But I prefer to use the command-based 
method used in Labs 1 and 2. The main reason for this is because I'm already used to it and I have more experience using 
command-based method then editor Atom, but I'm sure that I could learn to use both very efficiently.

For the use of git from NetBeans: In the Projects window, right-click the file you want to add. Then just follow the usual
way to commit our changes/documents. There are all the explications with details on the official site of NetBeans, I think 
that it' very well explained and very clear. What I dicovered is the fact that I can use git from NetBeans, I didn't even 
know that it was possible and now it's easier to use git, because I can use it directly from NetBeans.
